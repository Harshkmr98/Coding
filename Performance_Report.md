Performance Analysis and Design Decisions:

Time Complexity Analysis:

Greedy Coloring
Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This is because each vertex is considered once, and the adjacency list of each vertex is traversed.

Backtracking Coloring:
Time Complexity: O(m^V), where m is the number of colors and V is the number of vertices. This is due to the recursive nature of trying out all possible color assignments for each vertex.

Heuristic Optimization:
Time Complexity: Depends on the specific heuristic used (e.g., greedy heuristic). Generally, it aims to reduce the search space and improve the practical performance.

Space Complexity Analysis:
Greedy Coloring
Space Complexity: O(V + E) due to storage of the graph structure (adjacency list) and the color assignments.

Backtracking Coloring:
Space Complexity: O(V) for storing the current coloring assignment, with additional overhead for recursion stack space.

Heuristic Optimization:
Space Complexity: Similar to Greedy, but with possible additional space required for heuristic-related data structures.

Practical Performance:
The implementation is tested with graphs up to 10,000 vertices and 50,000 edges.

Greedy Coloring: Performs well for sparse and moderately dense graphs. Struggles with large, fully connected graphs in terms of color minimization.

Backtracking Coloring: Guarantees minimum color usage but is computationally expensive for large graphs.

Heuristic Optimization: Strikes a balance between greedy and backtracking approaches, offering near-optimal solutions with better performance.

Design Decisions:

Object-Oriented Design:

Encapsulation: Each class is responsible for a specific part of the problem (e.g., Graph, ConstraintManager). Data and methods are encapsulated within these classes.
Inheritance: Different coloring strategies inherit from a common interface or abstract class.
Polymorphism: The ColoringSolver uses polymorphism to apply different strategies dynamically.

Design Patterns:
Strategy Pattern: Applied in ColoringSolver to switch between different coloring strategies.
Factory Pattern: Used for dynamically creating solver instances based on input or configuration.

Code Readability
Modular Design: Code is broken down into small, manageable classes and methods.
Documentation: Clear docstrings and inline comments are provided to explain complex parts of the code.
Best Practices: Follows Python's PEP 8 guidelines for naming conventions and code structure.


Conclusion
This project demonstrates a robust approach to solving a complex graph coloring problem with multiple constraints. By leveraging OOP principles, design patterns, and careful performance considerations, the solution is both flexible and efficient, capable of handling large-scale graphs in a practical manner.
